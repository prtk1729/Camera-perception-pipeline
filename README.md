# Camera Perception Pipeline üöòüì∑

This project implements a complete **camera-based perception pipeline** for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) using **Python 3.9**, **Object-Oriented Programming**, and modern **deep learning models** like YOLOv5, YOLOv8, FasterRCNN, and SSD.

The pipeline is built step-by-step to process real-world **front camera data** collected from ADAS vehicles, and showcases a structured software engineering approach using **UML design** and **modular code** principles.
